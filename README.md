Disclaimer:

you said to explain my way of doing stuff, I explain everything in the code via comments

before judging me of why I used AI, please read the paragraph below fully and then decide if I did the right thing

I did use AI for the entire rest_framework, then asked why the AI did certain things in certrain lines, I learned from the explanations of what it was doing and now I have an idea how to remake the entire thing from scratch without any help of any sort of AI because of how clearly it explained everything to me, I use AI as a teacher for almost anything elementary, not a black box that does the things that I'm supposed to do

I used AI for it because it was my first time dealing with rest_framework and I didnt know how to do it and the official doccumentation was terrible and confusing

hope this way of using AI doesnt violate any of your rule, I gave u my reason and its up to you to either accept or reject this way

but thank you for the opportunity either way, I needed a push
